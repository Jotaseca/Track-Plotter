/*takes the fragmented data and generates a numerated list of track sections with the recommended
speed being: for curves, the original speed of the curve, and for straight parts: the best speed
taking in consideration the length of the straight part, acceleration times, and the max structural
speed of the project.
Also calculates section length.
Stores this.
